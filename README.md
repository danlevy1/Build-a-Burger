# Build-a-Burger

Code-along for this React [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) course. I used this course to learn React in depth, as a precursor to my senior design project (see [here](https://github.com/dgriessler/The-Music-Assistant)).



## Tech Stack

- React
- Redux
- React Router
- SCSS with CSS Modules



## Description

Build-a-Burger is a simple single page application (SPA) that allows a customers to build their favorite burger. The main page includes an interface to build the burger (I have to admit that the cool CSS styles for the burger itself were created by the course creator). Once a burger is created, the customer can check out using a form. User authentication is handled by Firebase Auth and the form data is stored in the Firebase Realtime Database. This data persistence allows the customer to view all orders at any time (see the "Orders" tab). The website is also mobile-friendly!
